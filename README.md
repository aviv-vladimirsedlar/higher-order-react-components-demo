A demonstration of Higher-Order React components
================================================

The components Country and CountryChooser display data synchronously -- it is passed to their props.

The higher order component Promised decorates a component class to load props asynchronously from a promise.

These are combined in the main.js entry point to load country information from HTTP+JSON APIs.
